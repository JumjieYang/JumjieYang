### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
 I'm Junjie Yang, a third year Computer Science Student at [McGill University](https://mcgill.ca).
 
  In Summer 2020, I worked with several awesome programmers at [JD.COM](https://jd.com) as a Software Engineering Intern. ðŸ”­
 > In particular, I joined JDH (JD Health)
 
> During that time, I was involved in implementing
 several core functionalities for [JDH-SaaS](https://ydgj.jd.com), [JDH-ERP](https://ydgj.jd.com), and A Wechat Mini Program for JDH. 
 
 > In addition to that, I worked with the Quality Assurance Team to implement a Quality Insurance Platform called qm.jd.com
